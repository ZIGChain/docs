### **B**

**Blockchain**: A decentralized ledger technology that records transactions in cryptographically linked blocks. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, forming an immutable chain maintained across a peer-to-peer network.

**Block**: A collection of transaction data in a blockchain.

---

### **C**

**Cosmos SDK**: The open-source framework used to build ZIGChain, known for its modularity and interoperability.

**Crypto Wallet**: A digital wallet used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

---

### **D**

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Financial services and products built on a blockchain that operate without traditional intermediaries.

---

### **E**

**Epoch**: A fixed time period during which validators process transactions and earn rewards for maintaining network operations.

---

### **G**

**Gas Fees**: Transaction fees paid to process operations on the ZIGChain blockchain.

**Governance**: The system by which decisions are made and implemented in the ZIGChain ecosystem.

---

### **I**

**Interoperability**: The ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other.

---

### **L**

**Layer 1**: The base level of blockchain architecture, responsible for all fundamental network operations.

**Liquidity**: The ease and speed at which an asset can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price.

---

### **M**

**Mainnet**: The fully operational blockchain network where genuine cryptocurrency transactions, smart contracts, and decentralized applications are executed, distinct from test environments.

**Minting**: The process of creating and issuing new cryptocurrency tokens, NFTs, or other digital assets on a blockchain.

---

### **N**

**Native Token**: A blockchain's inherent cryptocurrency that plays an integral role in network operations and governance. ZIG is the native token of ZIGChain.

---

### **O**

**Oracle**: A middleware service that securely connects a blockchain with external data sources.

---

### **P**

**Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism that selects validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they “stake,” rewarding those who contribute to network security.

---

### **R**

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: A communication protocol that allows applications to interact with the blockchain network remotely.

---

### **S**

**Smart Contract**: A blockchain program that automatically executes, verifies, and enforces digital agreements when predefined conditions are met.

**Staking**: The process of locking up cryptocurrency holdings to support network operations and earn rewards.

---

### **T**

**Testnet**: A blockchain testing environment where developers can experiment with new features and applications before deploying them to mainnet, using test tokens instead of real assets.

**Token**: A unit of value issued by a blockchain project, often used to interact with decentralized applications.

**Transaction**: An action recorded on the blockchain, such as transferring tokens or interacting with a smart contract.

**Total Value Locked (TVL)**: The aggregate value of all assets deposited and secured within a blockchain.

---

### **U**

**Unbonding Period**: The amount of time that a delegator must wait before they can access and move their tokens after unstaking.

---

### **V**

**Validator**: A node in a proof-of-stake system responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining network security.

---

### **W**

**Wealth Manager**: An individual or entity that deploys and manages investment strategies on ZIGChain.

**Wealth Management Engine (WME)**: ZIGChain's unique liquidity layer that simplifies complex DeFi operations for users.

**Web3**: The concept of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology, emphasizing user control and data ownership.

---

### **Z**

**ZIG**: The native token of the ZIGChain ecosystem, used for transactions, governance, and accessing platform features.

**ZIGChain**: A Layer 1 blockchain, designed to democratize access to wealth-generation opportunities.
