# Validators Overview

ZIGChain is a decentralized blockchain network powered by the Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol. ZIGChain relies on a network of validators to propose and verify new blocks. Validators play a crucial role in maintaining network security and operability by participating in the consensus process, validating transactions, and ensuring high uptime.

Validators can secure ZIGChain by staking their own tokens or receiving delegated ZIG from other token holders (delegators). Initially, ZIGChain will have 33 active validators. The **top 33 validators** with the most ZIG staked will be selected as **Active Validators**, ranked by the total amount of ZIG staked.

Both validators and delegators can earn ZIG for participating in block validation, with rewards coming from block rewards and transaction fees. Validators can also set a commission on delegator rewards to generate additional income.

To maintain high security and accountability, **validators can be slashed and penalized** for violating network rules or failing to meet performance requirements. The penalties can include slashing a portion of the ZIG staked by both the validator and their delegators, with the severity of the punishment varying based on the offense.

## Becoming a Validator in ZIGChain

Becoming a validator requires both technical expertise and financial commitment. Validators must operate and maintain a full ZIGChain node, which requires:

- Reliable internet connectivity,   
- Sufficient computational resources, and  
- Regular software maintenance to ensure optimal uptime and security.

Success as a validator extends beyond technical operations. Validators must also attract delegators to increase their total stake, which determines their ranking in the **Active Validator Set** and their ability to earn rewards. Many validators actively engage with the community to build trust and reputation.
