# Faucet

The **Faucet** page is a utility for users to request **free testnet tokens** on the ZIGChain network. Testnet tokens are used purely for testing purposes on the ZIGChain testnet and have no real-world monetary value. They allow developers and users to experiment with ZIGChain transactions, token management, and smart contract interactions without using real tokens.

## Why Use the Faucet?

The faucet provides an easy way to obtain testnet tokens to explore and build on ZIGChain's testnet. Whether you're a developer testing a new application or a user trying out different features of the ZIGChain network, these tokens empower you to:

- **Interact with ZIGChain features**: Test token transfers, staking, and other actions on the ZIGChain network.
- **Develop and debug applications**: Developers can simulate real transactions without the risk of losing actual tokens.

### Important: Testnet Tokens Only

These tokens are strictly for use on the testnet and have no real value. They’re used solely for testing purposes in a sandboxed environment. The testnet mirrors the main network’s features but operates separately, so transactions and balances on the testnet do not affect the main ZIGChain network.

## How to Use the Faucet

1. **Enter your ZIGChain Address**: Input your ZIGChain testnet address where you'd like to receive the tokens.
2. **Request Tokens**: Click the "Request Tokens" button to initiate the request. The tokens will be sent to your provided address shortly.

3. **Add ZIGChain to Wallet**:
   - If you haven’t already, you can add ZIGChain to your compatible wallet.
   - This step allows you to view and manage your testnet tokens through popular wallets like **Leap** and **Keplr**.

Using the faucet is a straightforward way to get started with the ZIGChain network, especially for those who want a risk-free environment to experiment.
