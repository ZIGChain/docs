# ZIGChain Hub

Welcome to the [**ZIGChain Hub**](https://hub.zigchain.com/) — your central hub for exploring and interacting with the ZIGChain network.
Here you can check your balances, stake tokens, take part in governance, and keep track of your transactions — all in one simple interface.

## What You Can Do in the Hub

### Portfolio

In the **Portfolio** is where you’ll see all your ZIGChain assets in one place.

- Check your current balance.
- Review your latest transactions at a glance.
- Keep track of the tokens available for staking or transfers.

Think of this as your personal ZIGChain wallet overview.

### Validators

The **Validators** section shows you all the network's validators.

- Compare voting power, bonded tokens, comissions and your staked coins.
- Pick the validators you trust and delegate your ZIG Token to them using **stake** button.

This is where you decide who works on your behalf in keeping ZIGChain safe.

### Staking

The **Staking** page is where you put your ZIG Tokens to work.

- Stake tokens with validators to secure the network and earn rewards.
- Track your staked balance, claimable rewards, and any tokens in the unbonding period.
- Use the **Stake** button next to a validator to delegate your tokens.
- Use **Modify** to add more stake, **unstake**, or **claim rewards** whenever you like.

Think of this as your rewards engine — the more you stake, the more you help ZIGChain grow while earning in return.

### Proposals

The **Proposals** page is where you take part in ZIGChain governance.

- View all proposals along with their status — **Voting**, **Passed**, or **Rejected**.
- Check details like proposal ID, title, and end time.
- Use your staked tokens to **vote** on active proposals and help shape the network's future.

Think of this as ZIGChain's decision-making hub — where every staker has a voice.

### Bridge

The **Bridge** page allows you to transfer ZIG tokens between Ethereum and ZIGChain networks.

- Connect your MetaMask wallet to access EVM tokens.
- Select your source chain and enter the amount to bridge.
- Generate a deposit address and send your ZIG tokens.
- Seamlessly transfer tokens between different blockchain networks.

Think of this as your cross-chain gateway — enabling seamless token transfers between ZIGChain and other blockchain networks.

### Transactions

The **Transactions** page keeps track of all your activity on ZIGChain.

- See your latest transactions with details like date, action, and amount.
- Actions include **Send**, **Stake**, **Unstake (Undelegate)**, and **Claim Rewards**.
- Each transaction links to its ID so you can verify it on the blockchain.

Think of this as your personal activity log — a clear record of everything happening with your ZIG Token.
