## How to Explore Proposals

### Step 1: Access the Proposals Page

1. Go to the [Proposals page](https://hub.zigchain.com/proposals/).
2. You'll see the summary cards showing the total count of proposals and their status distribution.

### Step 2: Browse and Search Proposals

1. **Use the Search Bar**: Type keywords to find specific proposals (e.g., "upgrade", "gas", "wasm")
2. **Apply Filters**: Use the dropdown to filter by status (All, Active)
3. **Browse the Table**: Scroll through the list to see all proposals with their details

### Step 3: Review Proposal Details

1. **Click on any proposal row** in the table to open the detailed proposal view.
2. **Navigate to the detail page** where you can see comprehensive information about the proposal.
3. **Read through all sections** to understand:
   - What changes are being proposed
   - Why the changes are needed
   - Potential impact on the network
   - Complete voting results and timeline
   - Technical details and metadata

### Step 4: Deposit to Proposals in Deposit Period

If a proposal is in "Deposit Period", you can contribute ZIG tokens to help it reach the minimum deposit requirement:

![proposal_deposit_general](./img/hub/proposal/proposal_deposit_1.png)

1. **Check deposit status**: Look for the deposit progress bar showing current/target ZIG amount
2. **Review deposit requirements**: Minimum deposit amount and deadline are displayed
3. **Click "DEPOSIT"**: Use the button to contribute to the proposal
4. **Enter deposit amount**: Specify how many ZIG tokens you want to deposit
5. **Confirm the transaction**: Approve the deposit in your connected wallet
6. **View updated deposit**: Once approved, the deposit amount on the proposal will be updated with your contribution

> üìù **Note**: Deposits for passed and failed proposals are returned. The proposal will fail if the minimum deposit isn't reached within the deposit period.

### Step 5: Vote on Active Proposals

If you have staked ZIG tokens and the proposal is in "Voting Period", you can participate in governance:

1. **Check if you can vote**: You need staked ZIG tokens to vote on proposals
2. **Review the proposal**: Read the details carefully before making your decision
3. **Cast your vote**: Choose from Yes, No, No with Veto, or Abstain
4. **Confirm the transaction**: Approve the vote in your connected wallet

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: If you don't vote, your vote will automatically follow your validator's choice. Only staked tokens count toward voting power.

#### Proposal Header

- **Proposal ID and Title**: Shows the proposal number and title (e.g., "#13: Upgrade to 1.2.0")

## How Voting Works on the Hub

### Voting Requirements

- **Staked Tokens**: You must have ZIG tokens staked with an active validator to vote
- **Active Proposals**: You can only vote on proposals in "Voting Period" status
- **Connected Wallet**: Your wallet must be connected to the Hub to cast votes

### Voting Options

When voting on a proposal, you can choose from:

- **Yes**: Support the proposal
- **No**: Oppose the proposal
- **No with Veto**: Strongly oppose the proposal (can veto if enough votes)
- **Abstain**: Neither support nor oppose, but contribute to quorum

### Validator Delegation

- **Your Vote Counts**: If you vote, your choice overrides your validator's vote
- **Automatic Delegation**: If you don't vote, your vote automatically follows your validator's choice
- **Voting Power**: Your voting power equals the amount of ZIG tokens you have staked
- **Independent Choice**: You can vote differently from your validator if you disagree with their position
