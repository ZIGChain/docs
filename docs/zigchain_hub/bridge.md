## How It Works ‚Äî Step by Step

### 1. Link your origin wallet

- Start by connecting the wallet that currently holds your tokens ‚Äî your **origin wallet**.  
  Choose the **asset** and the **networks** you‚Äôll use for this transaction, following a simple ‚Äú**From ‚Üí To**‚Äù logic.

  _Example:_ Bridging ZIG from your Ethereum wallet (**origin**) to your ZIGChain wallet (**destination**).

- Click **Connect Wallet** to link your wallet to the ZIGChain Hub.  
  Once connected, you‚Äôll see the **maximum transferable amount** for the selected token displayed on top.

### 2. Enter a valid amount

- In the upper panel, enter the amount you‚Äôd like to bridge.  
  You can also click **Max** to send all available tokens.

  üí° **Tip:** Ensure you have enough native currency (like **ETH** on Ethereum) to cover **gas fees**.

- Next, review:

  - The amount you‚Äôll receive, and
  - The estimated bridge fee, which updates automatically based on network conditions.

- When ready, click **Send**.

### 3. Set your destination wallet

Now it‚Äôs time to connect the wallet that will receive your tokens ‚Äî your **destination wallet**.

- Click the large **Set Destination Wallet** button and follow the prompts to connect.  
  Before confirming, carefully review all transaction details.

- When everything looks correct, click **Confirm**.

- Your **origin wallet** will then prompt you to approve the transaction.  
  Some wallets may require **multiple confirmations**, so keep an eye on your wallet notifications.

- Your transfer is now on its way.  
  Processing may take around 20 minutes depending on network traffic.

  - Click **Track Progress** to open the transaction in the **Skip Explorer**.
  - The status will show as _Pending_ until the process completes.
