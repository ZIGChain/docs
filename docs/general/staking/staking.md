# Staking

ZIGChain Staking is a decentralized process that enables users to **enhance the networkâ€™s security** and **governance** by delegating their ZIG tokens to validators. In return, **participants earn rewards** for their contributions.

ZIGChain utilizes the Tendermint Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism to secure its blockchain, ensuring robust and efficient consensus. Staking is a critical component of the ZIGChain ecosystem, driving its security, decentralization, and long-term resilience.

## Key Components of Staking on ZIGChain

Staking on ZIGChain revolves around two key participants:

### Validators

Validators are node operators who:

- Validate transactions, create new blocks, and secure the network
- Maintain secure, highly available infrastructure
- Earn rewards from transaction fees and block rewards
- Are selected based on total delegated ZIG tokens (self-staked \+ delegators)

### Delegators

Delegators are ZIG holders who:

- Participate in network security without operating validator infrastructure
- Contribute to decentralization by delegating tokens to validators
- Earn a portion of block rewards and transaction fees
- Carefully select validators based on performance and reputation
- Share risks, including potential slashing penalties

## How Staking Works on ZIGChain

Staking on ZIGChain follows these steps:

1. **Select a Validator**:

   - Choose from available validators to delegate your ZIG tokens
   - Validators are ranked based on their performance, commission rates, and other factors
   - You can distribute your tokens across multiple validators to diversify your stake

2. **Delegate ZIG Tokens**:

   - Delegate your ZIG tokens to the selected validator using the ZIGChain CLI or a wallet interface
   - Select the amount of ZIG tokens you wish to delegate to your chosen validator(s)

3. **Earn Rewards**:

   - Earn staking rewards based on your delegated amount
   - Rewards are distributed automatically by the network

4. **Unstake**:
   - Delegators can unstake (undelegate) ZIG tokens to withdraw them from the staking pool
   - A 21-day waiting period (unbonding) applies to all unstaking requests for network security
   - ZIG tokens become available for withdrawal after this period

## Security Measures: Slashing and Penalties

While staking on ZIGChain is rewarding, it also comes with inherent risks due to slashing mechanisms. Slashing is a penalty enforced on validators (and indirectly their delegators) for misconduct or negligence. This mechanism ensures that validators remain accountable and uphold the networkâ€™s integrity.

Types of Slashing Events

- **Double Signing**: If a validator signs two conflicting blocks at the same height, they incur a severe penalty. This type of violation is considered highly detrimental to network integrity and results in a 5% slash on staked tokens, along with the validatorâ€™s removal from the active set.
- **Downtime**: Validators must maintain high uptime. If a validator goes offline for an extended period, they incur a slashing penalty (0.01%). This penalty is intended as a minor deterrent, encouraging validators to maintain high uptime without severely impacting their stake.
