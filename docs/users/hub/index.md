# ZIGChain Hub

Welcome to the [**ZIGChain Hub**](https://hub.zigchain.com/) — the central portal for monitoring balances, staking, governance, cross-chain transfers, and every other way you interact with ZIGChain. Everything you need is available from a single, secure dashboard.

## Features

- **Portfolio**: Track your ZIG balances, recent transactions, and tokens that can be staked or transferred.
- **Validators**: Compare voting power, bonded tokens, commission, and your own delegations.
- **Staking**: Delegate, claim rewards, and manage unbondings without leaving the interface.
- **Proposals**: Browse, research, and vote on governance proposals using your staked tokens.
- **Transactions**: View a searchable history of every on-chain action you take.
- **Bridge**: Transfer ZIG tokens between Ethereum and ZIGChain safely.

## What You Can Do in the Hub

### Portfolio

The **Portfolio** section gives a clear snapshot of all your ZIGChain assets:

- Check balances and tokens available for use or staking.
- Review recent transactions with a glance.
- See how much of your holdings are already delegated.

It’s your personal wallet overview combined with analytics.

### Validators

The **Validators** page surfaces every active operator so you can:

- Compare voting power, commissions, bonded stake, and uptime.
- Delegate with the **Stake** button to validators you trust.
- Monitor how your delegations impact the active set.

These operators secure ZIGChain for you — choose the ones that match your risk profile.

### Staking

Staking puts your ZIG tokens to work:

- Delegate to validators and earn rewards.
- Track claimable rewards and unbonding periods.
- Use **Modify** to stake more, unstake, or claim whenever you like.

Every staking decision reinforces the network while growing your position.

### Proposals

Governance lives inside the Hub:

- Browse proposals by status (Voting, Passed, Rejected).
- Open a proposal to read descriptions, metadata, proposer details, and timelines.
- Vote using Yes/No/No with Veto/Abstain to shape ZIGChain’s direction.

This is where every staker makes their voice heard.

### Bridge

Move ZIG between chains without leaving the Hub:

- Connect MetaMask or another supported wallet.
- Select the source chain and amount, then generate a deposit address.
- Track the inbound/outbound bridge transaction directly from the dashboard.

Think of it as your cross-chain gateway for ZIG liquidity.

### Transactions

The **Transactions** feed logs every interaction:

- Filter by action (Send, Stake, Unstake, Claim Rewards, etc.).
- Open a transaction to jump straight to a block explorer.
- Confirm statuses, fees, and timestamps instantly.

It’s your personal activity log — verifiable and transparent.

## Why Use the Hub?

- **Simple**: Everything you need in a single, intuitive experience.
- **Secure**: Connect trusted wallets like Leap and Keplr — your keys, your control.
- **Transparent**: Real-time validator, proposal, and portfolio data keep you in the know.
