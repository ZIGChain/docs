# Integration Guides

This section gathers the documentation that external wallets, exchanges, explorers, and service providers rely on when integrating with ZIGChain.

- [ZIGChain RPC and API Endpoints](./endpoints.md)
- [Register Your Token in Cosmos Wallets](./register-your-token-in-cosmos-wallets.md)
